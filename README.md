# MHMDA
MHMDA is a biologically interpretable multi-hop metapath and HeteroHyperNet (HHN) learning approach for predicting miRNA-disease associations. It captures specific associated pathways through hierarchical attention, integrates heterogeneous and hyper network structures, and combines local and global perspectives to enhance accuracy.
